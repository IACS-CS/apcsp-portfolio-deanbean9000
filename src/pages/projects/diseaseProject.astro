  assignment="Simulate a disease using a model and graphs. "
>
  <p> For my simulations i added a recovery period and immunity to the original handshake disease. For the second Simulation i modeled the ebola virus, i added death rate, incubation rate, and recovery rate.
I tried to capture the randomized spread of the illness by making the people randomize who they become in contact with every turn. I also modeled the death and survival rate to get an accurate depiction of what happened.
